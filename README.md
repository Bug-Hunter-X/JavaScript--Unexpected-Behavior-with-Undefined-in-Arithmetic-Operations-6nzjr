# JavaScript: Unexpected Behavior with Undefined in Arithmetic Operations

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to how it handles `undefined` values in arithmetic operations. Specifically, adding a number and `undefined` results in `NaN` (Not a Number), which might lead to unexpected behavior in applications. 

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved handling of `undefined` values.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and input validation in JavaScript to prevent unexpected results and improve code reliability.
